`NCC` package allows users to simulate platform trials and to compare arms using non-concurrent control data.

## Design overview

We consider a platform trial evaluating the efficacy of $K$ treatment arms compared to a shared control. We assume that treatment arms enter the platform trial sequentially. In particular, we consider a trial starting with one initial treatment arm, where a new arm is added after every $d=(d_1,...,d_K)$ patients have been recruited to the trial (with $d_1=0$).

We divide the duration of the trial into $S$ periods, where the periods are the time intervals bounded by times at which a treatment arm either enters or leaves the platform.

The below figure illustrates the considered trial design.
