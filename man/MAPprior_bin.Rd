}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Trial data, e.g. result from the \code{datasim_bin()} function. Must contain columns named 'treatment', 'response' and 'period'.}

\item{arm}{Indicator of the treatment arm under study to perform inference on (vector of length 1). This arm is compared to the control group.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level. Default=0.025}

\item{opt}{Binary. If opt==1, all former periods are used as one source; if opt==2, periods get separately included into the final analysis. Default=2.}

\item{prior_prec_tau}{Dispersion parameter of the half normal prior, the prior for the between study heterogeneity. Default=4.}

\item{n.samples}{Number of how many random samples will get drawn for the calculation of the posterior mean, the p-value and the CI's. Default=1000.}

\item{n.chains}{Number of parallel chains for the rjags model. Default=4.}

\item{n.iter}{Number of iterations to monitor of the jags.model. Needed for coda.samples. Default=4000.}

\item{n.adapt}{Number of iterations for adaptation, an initial sampling phase during which the samplers adapt their behavior to maximize their efficiency. Needed for jags.model. Default=1000.}

\item{robustify}{Boolean. Indicates whether a robust prior is to be used. If TRUE, a mixture prior is considered combining a MAP prior and a weakly non-informative component prior. Default=TRUE.}

\item{weight}{Weight given to the non-informative component (0 < weight < 1) for the robustification of the MAP prior according to Schmidli (2014). Default=0.1.}

\item{check}{Boolean. Indicates whether the input parameters should be checked by the function. Default=TRUE, unless the function is called by a simulation function, where the default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Further arguments for simulation function.}
}
\value{
List containing the following elements regarding the results of comparing \code{arm} to control:
\itemize{
\item \code{p-val} - p-value (one-sided) obtained by drawing \code{n.samples} random samples from each posterior distribution
\item \code{treat_effect} - estimated treatment effect in terms of the log-odds ratio obtained by drawing \code{n.samples} random samples from each posterior distribution
\item \code{lower_ci} - lower limit of the 95\% confidence interval obtained by drawing \code{n.samples} random samples from each posterior distribution
\item \code{upper_ci} - upper limit of the 95\% confidence interval obtained by drawing \code{n.samples} random samples from each posterior distribution
\item \code{reject_h0} - indicator of whether the null hypothesis was rejected or not (\code{p_val} < \code{alpha})
}
}
\description{
This function performs analysis of binary data using the Meta-Analytic-Predictive (MAP) Prior approach. The method borrows data from non-concurrent controls to obtain the prior distribution for the control response in the concurrent periods.
}
\details{
In this function, the argument \code{alpha} corresponds to \eqn{1-\gamma}, where \eqn{\gamma} is the decision boundary. Specifically, the posterior probability of the difference distribution under the null hypothesis is such that:
\eqn{P(p_{treatment}-p_{control}>0) \ge 1-}\code{alpha}.
In case of a non-informative prior this coincides with the frequentist type I error.

\examples{

trial_data <- datasim_bin(num_arms = 3, n_arm = 100, d = c(0, 100, 250),
p0 = 0.7, OR = rep(1.8, 3), lambda = rep(0.15, 4), trend="stepwise")

MAPprior_bin(data = trial_data, arm = 3)
